# DeliSim
A 2D game engine built using SDL and Box2D.

This is the beginning stages of a 2D game engine. 
It incorporates SDL for rendering and easy access to hardware. More information on SDL can be found at https://www.libsdl.org/
Box2D is a 2D physics engine. More information on Box2D can be found at http://box2d.org/


This repository does not include either of these projects. They are both available for free, though. Yay.

Unsurprisingly, this project requires both of them to compile. More precise instructions on how to get this project 
to compile will come as I actually figure that out myself (It's been a while since I first put this all together).
